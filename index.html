<h3>Problem</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Physical textbooks are very expensive (often >$100 per book).</li>
    <li>After the course is finished, the textbook doesn't get used anymore 
        and takes up space on the bookshelf.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>Create an application that allows BMCC students to buy & sell 
    used textbooks</p>

<ul>
    <li>Users can post books for sale.</li>
    <li>Users can view the books that other users have put up for sale, 
        including details like the title, author, edition, and course.</li>
    <li>If users don't see the book they want, they can post a request
        for that book.</li>
</ul>
